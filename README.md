# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, organized by year with each year implemented in a different programming language.

## Repository Structure

Each year has its own folder with solutions implemented in a specific programming language:

```
adventofcode/
├── 2025/          # Rust
│   ├── day1/
│   ├── day2/
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

## Languages by Year

| Year | Language | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| 2025 | Rust     | In Progress |

## Running Solutions

Each year's folder contains specific instructions for running solutions in that language. See the README in each year's directory for details.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming challenges that can be solved in any programming language. Each day from December 1st to December 25th, a new two-part puzzle is released.

## Progress

- **2025**: Days completed: Check individual day folders

## Notes

- Each day's folder contains the puzzle input (`input.txt`) and solution code
- Solutions prioritize readability and learning over performance
- Each year explores a different programming language to broaden skills
